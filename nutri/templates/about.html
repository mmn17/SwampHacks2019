			<h1>Who are we?</h1>
			We are a group comprised of members of the Asian-American Student Union of Florida State University. Right now, our mission is to travel to as many hackathons as possible to network with potential employers and gain programming experience. We believe that by getting more experience and connections, we will be able to better navigate the industry and find opportunities beyond University.

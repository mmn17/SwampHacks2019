				Food is what people and animals eat to survive. Food usually comes from animals or plants. It is eaten by living things to provide energy and nutrition.[1] Food contains the nutrition that people and animals need to be healthy. The consumption of food is enjoyable to humans. It contains protein, fat, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. Liquids used for energy and nutrition are often called "drinks". If someone cannot afford food they go hungry.

				Food for humans is mostly made through farming or gardening. It includes animal and vegetable sources. Some people refuse to eat food from animal origin, like meat, eggs, and products with milk in them. Not eating meat is called vegetarianism. Not eating or using any animal products is called veganism.-->
